   Running
=============
To run, use the command
  java -r dist/sudoku_solver.jar
and follow the on screen commands.

Troublshooting
==============
Make sure you are in the correct directory (<folder location>/adb9_cs21120_assignment1/java_code).
Due to the way Java handles file systems it is difficult to predict where the sudokus directory will be.
